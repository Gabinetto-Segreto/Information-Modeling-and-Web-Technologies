          <br>
          <p>Infami Monumenti is a project that seeks to present a History of Phallic Culture, thinking of it as the invocation of the phallus the source of an alleged masculine power. Therefore, it was designed as a virtual museum with objects that present this culture and its main concepts: power, fertility, fortune and strength. There are specific settings for the page that presents all the objects, entitled <a href="#museum">Museum</a> and for the presentation of each object within the <a href="#narratives">Narratives</a>.</p>

            <h3>Layout</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Graphically representing a story of Phallic Culture involved thinking about what the metaphors of this culture are. The verticality of objects that mimic the phallus in different cultures was the first starting point. It also represents, in some of the societies presented here, the notion of fertility, in a clear allusion to the growth of plants, animals and fortunes. To achieve this, the use of sidebars to guarantee access to content was prioritized. Another functionality explored was content scrolling. This required the use of wide margins for large screens, and dynamic layout programming that prevents text from being squeezed onto smaller screens.</p>

            <h3>Colors</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As Priapus is the most recurrent Western representation over time of the concept of the phallus as a symbol of power, we chose the most famous image of this deity, the fresco from the Casa dei Vetti in Pompeii as the starting point for the overall color palette of this project. The colors were extracted using palette identification tools through images such as those offered by Canva and Adobe Color. Thinking of the website as a virtual museum, neutral and soft colors were designed for the background. In contrast, the body texts were given bold colors.</p>

            <br>
            <p>As the project sought to portray the history of phallic culture in different contexts, the choice was made for a neutral font, avoiding interference in the presentation of the objects. At the same time, this font would have to have flexibility in its styles, allowing for some variation, allowing parts of the text to stand out. The choice fell on the <a href = "https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter">Inter font</a>. In the titles, the font has been used in its ExtraBold 800 variation and in the text in Light 300.</p>

          <h2>Museum</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The organization of items to tell the History of Phallic Culture was thought of as a museum exhibition. One of the inspirations was the <a href="https://mann-napoli.it/gabinetto-segreto/">Gabinetto Segreto of the National Archaeological Museum of Naples</a>. This section of the MAN contains, since the time of the Bourbon sovereigns of Naples, all works considered erotic or obscene, including some of the testimonies of phallic culture that were selected in this project.</p>

            <h3>Layout</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Trying to reproduce the feeling of starting a visit to a museum, we sought a different layout on this page. By placing the museum plan occupying the entire page, the desire was to prevent the user from having any suggestion of what their visit will be like, seeking to reproduce the feeling of the visitor who finds himself at the entrance of a museum. Even though the navbar is available for the user to access objects in another way, the arrangement of the page's main content occupying the entire screen is an invitation for the user to explore a space freely. As in many museums, works are presented im rooms according to their type of production: architecture, literary works, paintings, sculptures and frescoes. To achieve this effect, the <q>Museum</q> page was diveded in different columns and rows to replicate the structure of a museum plan. For this, a grid was used with columns of different sizes in each row. Then, photos of objects of each type were inserted into carousels, allowing the user to have a preview of the objects in each room. </p>

            <p>To create the grid that mimics the floor plan of a museum, the color palette was slightly changed. As it was necessary to create a great contrast between each of the rectangles (the rooms), we chose a palette that is present in the excavations of Pompeii and found in different studies on color in statues of the period.</p>

Each "slide" in the story corresponds to a specific location on the map, highlighted as viewers navigate through the slides. The narrative panel contains multimedia content, including text, images, and videos, providing context and enhancing the story. Some media elements need to be programmed in HTML within the tool.

            <p>For the map styling we used <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>, a powerful mapping platform that enables developers to build and integrate custom maps and location-based services into applications. Offering robust APIs and SDKs, Mapbox provides detailed, interactive maps with customizable styles. Using the tool, we chose earthy tones from the tones already used on the other pages. This choice is related to the ancient belief that the phallus would be a symbol of fertility, including in agriculture, leading to the use of tones belonging to this universe.</p>

Despite offering a very extensive API, attempts to change the source proved unsuccessful, and according to Knightlab itself, this is a problem that has not yet been resolved in the tool's JavaScript. However, it was possible to find fonts with similar characteristics to those chosen on the rest of the page: for the titles the font is <a href = "https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway">Raleway</a> and for the other texts <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter">Bitter</a> was used.</p>

            <p>The design inspiration revolves around fertility metaphors, linked to phallic culture, appearing as a tangled branch that occupies in waves the page (for 992 pixels or more screen-sizes) or verticaly (for smaller screens). To produce this effect, the navigation is visually enhanced with horizontal and vertical lines and rounded corners. The objective is emphasizing both historical significance and symbolic representation. The page culminates in a call to action with a button leading to the “Museum” section, which provides a more detailed virtual exploration of phallic cultural artifacts.</p>
            <p>The page uses Bootstrap 5.3 for responsive design, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.</p>

          <h2>Narratives</h2>
          <br>
          <p>In order to represent the variety of objects associated to the theme of the exhibition, items were organized according to three main narratives: chronologically, spatially and by genre. The first narrative groups the objects according to the century they were created in, revealing the persistency of symbolic representations associated to fertility and virility throught time. The spatial narrative organizes items according to the location where the creation of the content took place <!--, as well as the culture from which the representation stem,--> and it is yet another way to observe the widespread cult of the phallus and the meanings associated to it worldwide. Finally, in the last narratives items are presented according to their genre, from visual artifacts - like paintings, frescos and sculptures - to literary works, to more recent experiments in architecture.</p>

          <div class="doc-content" id="features_narratives">
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Along with the option to switch narratives from the fields in the table, we decided to reintroduce the categories in which the items are organized in an offcanvas element, both to provide the user with an overview of the available options and to make navigation more immediate. The offcanvas can be toggled from a secondary navbar, that also includes a link to a modal window with some information on how to use the app.</p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>For each item in our exhibition, variables in the table were mapped to properties from <a href="https://schema.org/" target="_blank">Schema Ontology</a>. The best solution for displaying the Schema properties in the application seemed to be using popups, so that the basic properties are always visible, and the Schema properties — which may be of interest only to a specialized audience — can be activated when needed, thus ensuring the ability to view the mapped property without losing sight of the original property. With the premise that the number of properties varies depending on the item (for example, not all objects have an author, and it hasn't always been possible to associate an authority control), the selected properties are listed below, along with a brief description of its meaning and usage.</p>
            <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
              <tr><th>Feature</th><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr>
              <tr><td>Time</td><td>dateCreated</td><td>The property is used in order to express the date of creation of a creative work</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Conservation location</td><td>spatial</td><td>This is a general property to be used when more specific ones, like contentLocation or locationCreated, are not appropriate. In this case, we chose the spatial property to indicate the place where the item is located and preserved</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Author</td><td>Author</td><td>The property is used to indicate the creator of a creative work</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Authority</td><td>sameAs</td><td>The property is used to indicate a URL that uniquely identifies the item</td></tr>

            <h3>Layout</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Starting from the article which inspired the title of the project, we tried to use strategies that could convey a sense of monumentality. Specifically, we organized the exhibition page in well defined horizontal and vertical areas, by meshing up Bootstrap components - such as the main navbar, the modal and the offcanvas elements - and CSS grid. The resulting layout is composed of three columns, one for each content available for the item: an image, some textual content and a table that gathers the main information about the object.</p>
              <figure class="figure doc-figure">
                <img src="images/main_layout_screenshot.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="main layout screenshot">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A screenshot of the application page on laptop screen sizes</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>To avoid overcrowding the page and, at the same time, maintain the same design principle, for smaller screens we adopted a two-column layout, where the columns are preceded by the name of the item to which the contents refer. Textual content and image are displayed by default, while the table can be toggled by the user. Concurrently, the width of the offcanvas which controls the narratives selection was adjusted to convey a stronger sense of verticality by splitting the screen in half.</p>
