# Information-Modeling-and-Web-Technologies
<p>This <a href="https://gabinetto-segreto.github.io/Information-Modeling-and-Web-Technologies/">website</a> is an end-of-course project for the <a href="https://www.unibo.it/it/studiare/dottorati-master-specializzazioni-e-altra-formazione/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2023/454464">Information Modeling and Web Technologies</a> course of the Master Degree in <a href="https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge">Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge (DHDK)</a>, held by professor Fabio Vitali.</p>
                <p>The title of our project, <i>Infami monumenti</i>, is a reference to an article, published by <a href="https://mann-napoli.it/">National Archeological Museum of Naples (MANN)</a> in 2022, on the opening of the Secret Cabinet, a collection of erotic-themed objects dating back to the Roman era. The collection consists of about 250 artifacts organized by functions and classes of materials: frescoes with mythological subjects, garden decorative elements, brothel paintings, banquet hall furnishings, amulets, and phallic-themed objects present on the streets of Pompeii.</p>
                <p>Unlike the original collection, our website is not strictly focused on erotic objects, but on everything that can somehow be considered as an expression of the phallus as source of life and power, from the most ancient religious icons to rather recent examples suggested by the employment of vertical structures in architecture. The aim is to show how the association between virility and power is a cultural model spread among cultures and places distant in time and space and often characterized by very different beliefs and customs.</p>
                <p>Due to the nature of the topics treated, the exhibition is better suited for an adult audience. The different angles from which the objects can be selected (chronology, geography and artistic expression) and the possibility to adjust the length and details of the content make the exhibition suited for audiences with different kinds of interests and knowledge on the topic.</p>
