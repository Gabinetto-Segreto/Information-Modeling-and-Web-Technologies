                <h2>Sexual imagery</h2>
                <p>In Plautus' play Poenulus, phallic imagery serves as a rich source of humor and cultural commentary. One prominent example is the phallic amulet mentioned by the character Hanno. Early in the play, Hanno jokes about a "phallus-shaped charm" that supposedly brings good luck and wards off evil. This charm reflects Roman beliefs, where the phallus symbolized fertility and protection, showcasing how Plautus integrates cultural symbols into his comedic narrative.</p>
                <p>Another notable phallic element is the phallic lamp used for humor throughout the play. This lamp, designed in the shape of a phallus, represents a traditional Roman talisman believed to bring fortune and safeguard against malevolent forces. Hanno's comedic commentary on the lamp's shape and supposed magical properties highlights its significance in Roman society as both a protective charm and a source of humor.</p> 
                <p>Additionally, the play features a "phallic dance" performed by slaves, which echoes the Roman fertility rites and comedic festivals like the Lupercalia. This dance uses exaggerated movements and gestures to create a farcical representation of the phallus, emphasizing its role in Roman entertainment and fertility celebrations. The comedic performance illustrates how the phallus was not only a symbol of virility but also a tool for humor in Roman comedic traditions.</p>
                <p>Throughout Poenulus, sexual humor and innuendos play a central role. Plautus employs phallic jokes and references to explore themes of power, masculinity, and deception. The dialogue often includes lighthearted sexual innuendos that reflect societal attitudes towards the phallus as a symbol of virility and authority.</p>
                <p>In essence, Plautus weaves phallic symbols into Poenulus to blend cultural beliefs with comedic elements, using these symbols to entertain audiences while also commenting on Roman customs and values.</p>
