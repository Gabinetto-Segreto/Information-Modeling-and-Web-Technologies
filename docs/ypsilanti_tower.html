                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>An ordinance passed on April 14, 1898, established a yearly rate schedule for residences with running water. Rates were based on the number of faucets in use, the type of business that customers operated and the livestock they owned. A residence with one tap was charged $5 and a private bathtub cost an additional $2. Saloon keepers paid $7 for one faucet, $3 for each additional faucet and $1 for each billiard table. Each cow a person owned cost $1. People who failed to pay their bill were subject to a $50 fine and 90 days in the county jail.</p>
                <p>During the construction, hoping to protect themselves from injury, the builders made at least four crosses in the stonework, one over the west door, an elaborate but difficult to find Greek Cross on the east side and two inside the water tower. It was completed on February 3, 1890, at the cost of $21,368.</p>
                <p>The structure was the only water tower in the Ypsilanti water system until 1956. The Ypsilanti Community Utilities Authority began operating and maintaining the structure in 1974. That same year the tower was designated by the American Water Works Association as an American Water Landmark. It was also designated a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the Michigan Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers. In 1976 it was restored.</p>
                <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p>The exterior was designed in the popular Queen Anne style of the period. Queen Anne design was less formal than other popular styles at the time; instead it experimented with different shapes particularly towers. Queen Anne buildings also often had more decoration than this structure.</p>
                <p>The stone tower is located at the highest point of elevation of the city on Summit Street. The tower is made of Joliet limestone. The tower is 147 feet (45 m) tall, has an 85-foot (26 m) base. The substructure walls taper from a thickness of 40 inches (100 cm) at the bottom to 24 inches (61 cm) at the top. The reservoir holds a 250,000-US-gallon (950,000 L) steel tank. When it was constructed it had a dual purpose. Not only did it store water but the falling water also generated electricity for the city street lamps at night.</p>
                <p>A marble bust of Demetrios Ypsilantis stands between a Greek and a U.S. flag at the base of the water tower. The city of Ypsilanti is named after this hero of the Greek War of Independence.</p>
                <h2>Present day</h2>
                <p>The tower has long been a source of humor for comedians in the Ann Arborâ€“Ypsilanti area, for its phallic shape; it has been nicknamed "the Brick Dick". An urban legend holds that the tower will crumble if a virgin graduates from nearby Eastern Michigan University. In 2003 Cabinet magazine ranked the tower as the World's Most Phallic Building.</p>
