                <h2>Priapus and the satyrs</h2>
                <p>The Satyroi (Satyrs) were rustic fertility spirits of the countryside and wilds. They consorted with the Nymphai (Nymphs) and were companions of the gods Dionysos, Hermes, Hephaistos, Pan, Rhea-Kybele and Gaia.</p>
                <p>Satyroi were depicted as animalistic men with asinine ears, pug noses, reclining hair-lines, the tails of horses and erect members. As companions of Dionysos they were usually shown drinking, dancing, playing flutes and sporting with the Mainades (Maenads).</p>
                <p>Some of the more specific types of Satyroi were the Panes (goat-legged satyrs), Seilenoi (Silens) (elderly satyrs), Satyriskoi (Satyrisci) (child satyrs), and Tityroi (flute-playing satyrs).</p>
                <p>Actors dressed as Satyroi formed the choruses of the so-called Satyr-plays which were performed at the festivals of the god Dionysos.</p>
                <h2>Priapus and the Nymph Lotis: some readings</h2>
                <h3>Ovid, <i>Fasti</i> 1. 391 ff (trans.Boyle) (<i>Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.</i>)</h3>
                <p> "A donkey, too, is killed for the countryside's stiff guard [Priapos (Priapus)]. The cause is shameful, but it suits the god. You were holding, Greece, the feast of grape-crowned Bacchus [Dionysos], celebrated by custom each third winter. The gods who serve Lyaeus [Dionysos] also attended and whoever is not hostile to play, namely Panes and young Satyri (Satyrs) and goddesses who haunt streams and lonely wilds [Naiades and Dryades]. Old Silenus came, too, on a sway-backed donkey, and the red-groined terror of timid birds [i.e. garden statues of Priapos functioned as scarecrows]. They discovered a grove suitable for party pleasures and sprawled on grass-lined couches. Liber [Dionysos] supplied wine, they had brought their own garlands, a brook gave water for frugal mixing. Naiades were there, some with hair flowing uncombed, others with locks artfully coiffured... Some generate tender fires inside the Satyri...<br> But red Priapus, the garden's glory and protection, fell victim above all to Lotis. He desires her, he wants her, he sighs for her alone; he nods at her and pesters her with signs. Disdain defines the pretty, beauty is trailed by pride : she teases and scorns him with her looks. It was night. Wine induced slumber and prone bodies lay everywhere, conquered by sleep. Lotis rested furthest away, tired from partying, in the grass beneath some maple branches. Her lover rises and, holding his breath, tracks secretly and silently on tiptoe. When he had reached the snow-white Nympha's secluded bed, he took care his breathing was soundless. And now he was poised on the grass right next to her, and still she was filled with a mighty sleep. His joy soars; he draws the cover from her feet and starts the happy road to his desires. Then look, the donkey, Silenus' mount, brays loudly, and emits untimely blasts from its throat. The terrified Nympha leaps up, fends Priapus off, and awakens the whole grove with her flight. And the god, whose obscene part was far too ready, was ridiculed by all in the moon's light. The author of the clamour [the donkey] was punished with death. He's a victim dear to Hellespont's god."</p>
                <h3>Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i> 9. 346 ff (trans. Melville)</h3>
                <p>"There is a lake [in Oikhalia (Oechalia)] whose shelving sides had shaped a sloping shore, and myrtles crowned the ridge... Near the lakeside was a water-lotus flowered, its crimson blooms like Tyrian dye, fair hope of fruit to come... this shrub was the Nymphe Lotis who fled Priapus's lechery and found changed features there but kept her name."</p>
